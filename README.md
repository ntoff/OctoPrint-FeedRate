## OctoPrint-FeedRate

Puts the last sent feedrate number (G1 X20 Y90 Z2 E69 **F2000** <-- that number) into the navbar.

*Note: Because most printers contain some sort of buffer, the last sent feedrate may not be the actual feedrate the printer is currently operating at. This plugin is to be used only as a rough guide / estimate.*
